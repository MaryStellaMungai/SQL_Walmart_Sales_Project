# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves performing data analysis on Walmart sales data using SQL. The analysis includes database setup, feature engineering, data cleaning, and answering key business questions through SQL queries. The dataset used for this project is also included in the repository.

## Dataset
- **File**: `WalmartSalesData.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains Walmart sales data, which includes information about invoices, items, prices, and quantities.

## Key Questions Addressed
The analysis focuses on answering the following key business questions:

1. **What is the total revenue by month?**
2. **What is the most selling product line?**
3. **What month had the largest COGS?**
4. **What product line had the largest revenue?**

Detailed queries for each question can be found in the SQL script.

## SQL Script
- **File**: `SQL_Walmart_Sales_Project.sql`
- **Description**: This SQL script performs various tasks including:
  - Database setup and table creation.
  - Feature engineering and data cleaning.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL.
  - Answering key business questions through SQL queries.

Each query in the script is accompanied by comments that explain the question being answered.

## How to Use
1. **Dataset**: The dataset is available in the `WalmartSalesData.csv` file. You can load it into a SQL database to run the queries provided.
2. **SQL Script**: Use the SQL script (`SQL_Walmart_Sales_Project.sql`) to recreate the analysis. The script is written to be executed in MySQL, but can be adapted to other SQL environments.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how SQL can be used to analyze sales data and answer important business questions. By leveraging SQL's capabilities, we can gain insights into sales performance and make data-driven decisions
